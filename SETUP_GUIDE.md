## 🔧 Customization: Day-Specific Tracking

### What It Is
"Day-Specific Tracking" means assigning habits to ONLY certain days.

### How It Works
```
Habit: "Art of Pottery Class"
  ↓
Days Selected: Tuesday, Wednesday
  ↓
What Happens:
  - Checkboxes ONLY appear on Tue/Wed dates
  - Other days are blank (no clutter!)
  - Monthly goal auto-updates: 4 Tuesdays + 4 Wednesdays = Goal of 8
  - You only track it when you actually DO it
```

### Step-by-Step Setup
```
1. Open "Main Tracker" tab
2. Find the habit you want to customize
3. Click cell in "Days/Week Selected" column
4. Click the dropdown arrow
5. CHECK the days you want (M, T, W, etc.)
6. Leave UNCHECKED the days you don't want
7. Press DONE or click outside
8. ✨ Checkboxes instantly appear/disappear!
```

### Examples

**Structured Habit: Gym**
- Days: Monday, Wednesday, Friday
- Goal: 12 completions/month (3 per week × 4 weeks)
- Only checkboxes on M, W, F dates
- Can't accidentally check Saturday

**Class Habit: Yoga**
- Days: Tuesday, Thursday
- Goal: 8 completions/month (2 per week × 4 weeks)
- Only Tuesday & Thursday checkboxes shown
- Easy to see your attendance

**Appointment Habit: Therapy**
- Days: Wednesday (once per week)
- Goal: 4 completions/month
- Only Wednesday checkboxes available
- Perfect for recurring appointments

## 🎯 Customization: Custom Goal Mode

### What It Is
Track flexible habits without assigned days. You get ALL dates available.

### How It Works
```
Habit: "Morning Stretch"
  ↓
Days Selected: EMPTY (leave blank)
  ↓
What Happens:
  - ALL 30 days have checkboxes
  - Set your own monthly goal (e.g., "15 times")
  - Track whenever it fits your day
  - Perfect for flexible habits
```

### Step-by-Step Setup
```
1. Leave "Days/Week Selected" column BLANK
2. No dropdown needed - just leave it empty
3. Set your monthly goal in "Goal" column (e.g., 15)
4. All 30 date columns show checkboxes
5. Check whenever you do the habit!
```

### Examples

**Flexible Goal: "Drink Water 8+ Glasses"**
- No days assigned (flexible)
- Goal: 31 times (every day)
- Check every day you hit 8 glasses
- If you miss, it's okay - track the next day

**Flexible Goal: "Do 15 Minutes Stretch"**
- No days assigned (fit in whenever)
- Goal: 15 times this month
- Check when you complete it
- Could be morning, afternoon, or evening

**Flexible Goal: "Write in Journal"**
- No days assigned (your schedule)
- Goal: 25 times this month
- Write 3-4 times per week as it fits
- No pressure for specific days
